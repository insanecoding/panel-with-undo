# React, react-bootstrap, immutablejs & redux

## Test task for Netrika company

One simple page with panel, multiple input fields and remove/restore operation.

## Tech stack
* React + Redux
* ImmutableJS to manipulate state
* React-Bootstrap css framework
* Bundle with Webpack
* Project based on "create-react-app", well-known boilerplate. 
* logger middleware for convenience 

I tried to use Redux-undo for that task, but it slightly differs from general case, so simpler solution was found,
without this dependency
